AutoScaling
=======
AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically monitors and adjusts compute resources to maintain performance for applications hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud.

AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. 

Using AWS Auto Scaling, itâ€™s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes.

Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail.
Fault-tolerant systems use backup components that automatically take the place of failed components, ensuring no loss of service.

Benefits:
=====

	-Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances  available to handle the load for 	  	 	                 your application. 

	-Setup scaling quickly
	-Pay Only for What You Need
	-Automatically Maintain Performance
	-Make Smart Scaling Decisions


Steps:

1. Launch the instance
	connect to the putty
	
(#Advanced Details)


# !/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel  -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
systemctl start nginx 
sudo chkconfig nginx on
sudo yum install stress -y	

(Note: To increase the load need to install the 'Stress' software)

    AddTags step:
	Name: BaseMachine

2.Once instance is launched, copy the public DNS url and paste in browser. It has to display the nginx web page.

3. Connect through the SSH
	-check the stress software is installed or not
	[root@ip-10-1-1-140 ~]# stress --version
		
	[root@ip-10-1-1-140 ~]# service nginx status
		nginx (pid  2725) is running...
	((-checking the nginx is on or not
	[root@ip-10-1-1-140 ~]# chkconfig nginx on))

4. Now,we have setup everything, need to create an image now.
	select the instance and right click
	  create image->
		 imagename="Autoscalingimage"
		image description= Autoscalingimage
	<createimage>

5. Once completed with the above step, ssh connection will lost need to  reconnect the instance. Because, once we create image, it requires reboot.
	-Autoscaling is used for the static data
	-Autoscaling is mostly useful for the Webservers and ApplicationServers
	-Autoscaling is not used for the Database Servers.(Note:autoscaling is there for database using RDS)

6. Create a TargetGroup now,
	LoadBalancing
		TargetGroupName = Autoscaling-TG
		Protocol=TCP
		Port=80
		Targettype=Instance
		VPC=AWS-CLASSROOM
		<create>

7. Create a load balancer
	Select 'TCP' create
	 Name=LB-autoscaling    (ALB)
	VPC=AWS-CLASSROOM
	select all subnets of in 'availabilityzones'
	<nextscreen>
	  Target Group=existing target group
	   name=Autoscaling-TG
	
	<Register Targets>
	<create>
	
	-Check the AMI image is created under "Images-> AMI"


8. Autoscaling
	1. Launch Configurations or Launch Template
	2. Autoscaling Groups

	Create launch configurations -->launch the machine similar to EC2 instances except here
	need to select the "	MyAMIs"
		name=classroom-autoscaling
		'check' Enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring

9. Autoscaling Group
	-create autoscaling group
		-select 'use existing launching group'
		-select the existing machine <next>
		  Groupname= MyAutoScaling-group
		  Start with'1' instance
		  Network=AWS-CLASSROOM
		  subnet=select the 3 subnets in it

	Advanced Details
		Load balancing 'check' Receive traffic from one or more load balancers
		Target groups=from the dropdown select the existing target group 'Autoscaling'
		HealthChecktype=EC2
		Health Check Grace Period =30 seconds
		Monitoring= 'check'Enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring

	<configure scaling policies>
	
	'check' Use scaling policies to adjust the capacity of this group

	Scale between '1' and '3' instances. These will be the minimum and maximum size of your group.

	click the link 'Scale the Auto Scaling group using step or simple scaling policies'




add the new autoscaling policy details.............................





11. Create Auto Scaling Group
	 Name=AutoScalingServer
	<review>
	Once we complete these steps, immediately it will launch one instance in your EC2 instances.
	
12. Autoscaling
	AutoscalingGroup
	-check in <activity History>
	-New Instance will be create in EC2 instance 

13. Now, if you can check the new machine should  launch
	check in EC2 instances.
	- copy id of the machine we created i.e EC2 instance =i-0ccb8192774aefc33 (BaseMachine)
	  (because when we are destroying the autoscaling it has to start from here)

14. 
	Open three windows 
		one= EC2
		two=Load Balancer
		three=Autoscaling
	
	LoadBalancer
		under the description tab
		  copy the DNS name url=autoscaling-fd19634130f871b5.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
		  -open a private window and paste the url
		  -It should display the nginx server home page	
		
15. TargetGroups
	<targets>tab
		<registered targets>
		   autoscaling is added.

16. Need to increase the stress in cpu utilization
	Now login to the SSH for the 'AutoscalingServer' from EC2 -Instances
	 once login, check the 'stress' software is working or not
		[root@ip-10-1-3-193 ~]# stress
	
	EC2-Instances
		select the 'AutoscalingServer'
		  <Monitoring>tab
			CPU Utilization as of now, it is less than a 1%, so need to increase the cpu utilization.
			when it crosses more than 40%, it creates two instances automatically
		SSH
		    -[root@ip-10-1-3-193 ~]# stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 30m
			(Wait for 1 minute, so that cpu utilization is increases more than 40%)
		Once again you check the 
			-CPU Utilization (under the monitoring tab), now it shows more than 40%.
			- check in Autoscaling (activity history tab).It is launching 2 instances.
			-at the same time, in EC2, two new instances with 'AutoscalingServer' will be created.
