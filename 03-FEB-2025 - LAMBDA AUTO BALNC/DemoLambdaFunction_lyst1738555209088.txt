Real-World Use Cases
==================

Now, let's explore some real-world use cases to better understand how AWS Lambda can be applied:


  Automated Image Processing: 
	Imagine you have a photo-sharing app, and users upload images every day. 
	You can use Lambda to automatically resize or compress these images as soon as they are uploaded to S3.

  Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: 
	Build interactive chatbots or voice-controlled virtual assistants using Lambda. 
	These assistants can perform tasks like answering questions, fetching data, or even controlling smart home devices.

  Scheduled Data Backups: 
	Use Lambda to create scheduled tasks for backing up data from one storage location to another, 
	ensuring data resilience and disaster recovery.

  Real-Time Analytics: 
	Lambda can process streaming data from IoT devices, social media, or other sources, 
	allowing you to perform real-time analytics and gain insights instantly.

   API Backends: 
	Develop scalable API backends for web and mobile applications using Lambda. 
	It automatically handles the incoming API requests and executes the corresponding functions.
